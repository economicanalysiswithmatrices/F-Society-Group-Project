Start the game using Frogger.m, which loads up the menu screen.

Choose a difficulty using the dropdown box in the bottom right of the screen.

Please do not close the window while in the game. THE GAME WILL CLOSE BY ITSELF upon completing or failing to accomplish the aim of the game.
It is however fine to close the game on the Menu screen.

The aim of the game is to get the frog to the greener grass on the other side of the road(s).
Use the W ,S, A and D to move the frog up, down, left and right respectfully.

There are four difficulties to choose from.
1. Easy - Easiest mode made for beginners.
2. Hard - More cars, faster cars, can you handle it?
3. Hardest mode - More cars, faster cars and more lanes? This mode truly challenges the player.
4. Chaos mode - For those who think they can accomplish the impossible (Epilepsy warning).
