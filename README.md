There are four difficulties to choose from.
1. Easy - Easiest mode made for beginners.
2. Hard - More cars, faster cars, can you handle it?
3. Hardest - More cars, faster cars and more lanes? This mode truly challenges the player.
4. Chaos - For those who think they can accomplish the impossible (Epilepsy warning).
